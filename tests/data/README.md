# Test Data Files

This directory contains sample data files used for testing interoperability between `age-recipient-pq` and the age CLI.

## Files

- **lorem.txt**: A plaintext file containing Lorem ipsum text. Used as input for encryption tests to verify round-trip decryption matches the original byte-for-byte.

- **lorem.txt.age**: The `lorem.txt` file encrypted using the age CLI v1.3.1 with a post-quantum hybrid recipient. Used in `age_cli_interop_tests.rs` to test decryption with your library's identity parser.

- **age_cli_pq_identity.key**: The secret identity key (in age format) corresponding to the recipient used to create `lorem.txt.age`. This key is generated by the Go age CLI v1.3.1 and parsed by `age_recipient_pq::pq::HybridIdentity` in tests.

- **age_cli_pq_recipient.key**: The public recipient key (in age format) used by the Go age CLI v1.3.1 to encrypt `lorem.txt` into `lorem.txt.age`. It corresponds to the secret key in `age_cli_pq_identity.key`.

These files ensure tests cover real-world scenarios like CLI-generated encryption and compatibility with other age implementations.
